How to add a new PRNG to untwister:

New files to create:
    prngs/yourPRNG.cpp
    prngs/yourPRNG.h

Files to edit:
    Add header to PRNGFactory.h, like so:
        #include "yourPRNG.h"
    Add PRNG type to the PRNGFactory.cpp constructor's list, like so:
        library[YOUR_PRNG] = &create<YOUR_PRNG>;
        (Where YOUR_PRNG is a macro to a std::string that is the command line arg for your PRNG. Defined in yourPRNG.h)
    Add your PRNG to the Makefile. Try following in the footsteps of an existing one, like Ruby. Should be easy.
    Add unit tests!
        tests/testYourPRNG.cpp  / .h
            Follow an example from an existing test file. It's pretty straight forward
        Add to Runner.cpp in executeAllTests()
            runner.addTest(TestYourPRNG::suite());
        and the header:
            #include "TestYourPRNG.h"
